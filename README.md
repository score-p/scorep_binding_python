# scorep
scorep is a module that allows tracing of python scripts using [Score-P](http://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/).

# Install
You need at least Score-P 5.0, build with `--enable-shared` and the gcc compiler plugin.
Please make sure that `scorep-config` is in your `PATH` variable.

For Ubuntu LTS systems there is a non-official ppa of Score-P available: https://launchpad.net/~andreasgocht/+archive/ubuntu/scorep .

Then run

```
pip install .
```
# Use

To trace the full script, you need to run

```
python -m scorep <script.py>
```

The usual Score-P environment Variables will be respected. Please have a look at:

[www.vi-hps.org](http://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/)

and

[Score-P Documentation](http://scorepci.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de/scorep-pipelines/docs/latest/pdf/scorep.pdf)

There is also a small [HowTo](https://github.com/score-p/scorep_binding_python/wiki) in the wiki.

Since version 0.9 it is possible to pass the traditional Score-P commands to the Score-P bindings, e.g.:

```
python -m scorep --mpp=mpi --thread=pthread <script.py>
```

## MPI

To use trace an MPI parallel application, please specify

```
python -m scorep --mpp=mpi <script.py>
```

## User instrumentation
### User Regions
Since version 2.0 the python bindings support context managers for user regions:

```
with scorep.user.region("region_name"):
    do_something()
```

Since version 2.1 the python bindings support also decorators for functions:

```
@scorep.user.region("region_name")
def do_something():
    #do some things
```
If no region name is given, the function name will be used e.g.:

```
@scorep.user.region()
def do_something():
    #do some things
```

will result in `__main__:do_something`.

The traditional calls to define a region still exists, but the usage is discouraged:

```
scorep.user.region_begin("region_name")
scorep.user.region_end("region_name")
```

User parameters can be used in any case:

```
scorep.user.parameter_int(name, val)
scorep.user.parameter_uint(name, val)
scorep.user.parameter_string(name, string)
```

where `name` defines the name of the parameter or region, while `val` or `string` represents the value that is passed to Score-P. 

Disabeling the recording with Score-P is still also possilbe:

```
scorep.user.enable_recording()
scorep.user.disable_recording()
```

However, please be aware that the runtime impact of disabeling Score-P is rather small, as the instrumenter is still active. For details about the instrumenter, please see [Instrumenter](#Instrumenter).  

### Instrumenter
With version 2.0 of the python bindings, the term "instrumenter" is introduced. The instrumenter describes the class that maps the Python `trace` or `profile` events to Score-P. Please be aware, that `trace` and `profile` does not refer to the traditional Score-P terms of tracing and profiling, but to the Python functions [sys.settrace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace) and [sys.setprofile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setprofile).

The instrumenter that shall be used for tracing can be specified using `--instrumenter-type=<type>`.
Currently there are the following tacers available:
 * `profile` (default) implements `call` and `return`  
 * `trace` implements `call` and `return`
 * `dummy` does nothing, can be used without `-m scorep` (as done by user instrumentation)

The `profile` instrumenter should have a smaller overhead than `trace`. 

Moreover it is possible to disable (and enable) the instrumenter in the sourcecode:

```
with scorep.instrumenter.disable(region_name = None):
    do_something()

with scorep.instrumenter.enable(region_name = None):
    do_something()    
```

or during startup with `--noinstrumenter`. Please be aware that the function calls override the Flag.

If `region_name` is given, an not `None`, the region, where the istrumenter is active, will be marked with the given region name.

## Overview about Flags

The following flags are special to the python bindings:

 * `--noinstrumenter` disables the instrumentation of python code. Usefull for user instrumentation and to trace only specific code regions using `scorep.instrumenter.enable`.
 * `--instrumenter-type=<type>` choose an instrumenter. See  [Instrumenter](#Instrumenter).
 * `--keep-files` temporary files are kept.

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain backwards compatibility, the following flags are set per default:

```
python -m scorep --compiler --thread=pthread <script.py>
```

The traditional `--mpi` does still work, and is similar to the following call:

```
python -m scorep --compiler --thread=pthread --mpp=mpi <script.py>
```

To disable compiler instrumentation, please specify:

```
python -m scorep --nocompiler <script.py>
```

For other thread schemes just specify `--thread=<something>`. E.g. :

```
python -m scorep --thread=omp <script.py>
```

Please be aware the `--user` is always passed to Score-P, as this is needed for the python instrumentation.

# Compatibility
## Working
* python3 
* python2.7
* mpi using mpi4py
* threaded applications


## Not Working
* python multiprocessing
    * Score-P does currently only support MPI or SHMEM. Any other multiprocessing approach cannot be traced.
